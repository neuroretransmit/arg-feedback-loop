fou9fq	archival	f	79	/r/ARG/comments/fou9fq/possible_arg_hidden_in_halflife_alyx/	298	1	Possible ARG hidden in Half-Life: Alyx	So I’m pretty sure there’s a huge ARG hidden in Half-Life: Alyx that no one seems to have caught onto yet.\n\nAt the start of the game, if you turn the radio dial clockwise, you reach a station playing some very fuzzy music. However, if you pull the antenna out and very slowly turn the dial to the left end of the spectrum... you’ll eventually reach a ‘numbers station’. It seems to have some unique noises playing in it as well.\n\nAdditionally, when entering the North Star hotel, on the first floor in the bar there is a radio on the table in the middle of the bar.\n\nYou can’t interact with this radio, but it will briefly play a portion of a number station as well. I’m not sure if it’s the same recording or a different one.\n\nThis is really reminding me of the Portal 1 ARG with the radios that led into the Portal 2 announcement and release with the ARG players rebooting GlADoS\n\nI have absolutely no skills with this, and can’t find a single post or video on the internet about this. I’m letting y’all know in case anyone knows how to trawl the files and find the sound file for the number station, or more than just the one if there’s any more. I haven’t completed the game yet and may have missed other stuff.\n\nEDIT:\nMade a recording. \nhttps://mega.nz/#!9xUigYzC!7jOEtDzwu7-Zn710gTwHgNcdV9deiNYDRH2e9RjA6eQ\n\nits tough to get a clean sound, theres all the background environment, and the voice slows or speeds sometimes\n\nseems to be a pattern of "LETTER/NUMBER and LETTER/NUMBER" etc, and it sounds like there might be a few different strings, so i recorded for a while\n\nEDIT 2: Recording of the other radio in the northern star hotel bar.\nhttps://mega.nz/#!lgFUkajQ!UxbKq-cKjqI1TxVmkO0IpNkp6ieqJloCRP0DkBAx7c4\n\nEDIT 3:\nu/j-max04 did a high pass edit of the first recording to try and clear up some of the background noise. I think the station is easier to hear in it.

The only difference is that the false rods weigh 0.1kg more than the real gold. You have a scale and can only use it once and then it breaks. How do you figure out which box contains the false rods?	2021-09-04 00:56:57.910473	2021-09-04 00:56:57.910485	https://www.reddit.com/r/puzzles/comments/ht0paj/i_guess_this_fits_here/

Okay, so I was bored and made this simple cipher, its a relatively simple one, I found this cipher method while playing a game, and I figured out how to crack the game’s cipher in under 5 minutes and I decided to make my own fun puzzle with the cipher I had learned, so well, if you’re clever, have fun. There are two hints in the cipher itself to help and make sure to look keenly and you might want to think about it if you’re struggling. I think its a easily solvable cipher in under 10 minutes! \n\n<-> Cipher starts from here <->\n\nPee, tgn zfmjzcnq eq.\nTgn’jq mpzfb tgnj ydqoqj, xnm wjq tgn?\n.\nAjctcp, zsr grq icwcb.\n.\n‘Fglr’(q)\nUip’ml diicahy rim ao.\nSzwo wml uip omuahy oi rahg?\n\n<-> Cipher ends here <->\n\n\n[ V sbyybjrq gur ehyrf ]	2021-09-04 00:56:59.051363	2021-09-04 00:56:59.051378	https://www.reddit.com/r/codes/comments/htj1t0/a_very_simple_cipher_or_is_it_trust_me_it_is/

I only recently got into ARGs and was really excited to be apart of this community, but literally only after a few hours of browsing the subreddit I saw so much negativity and hatred towards other users and their projects. Is there something I'm not getting ? Is that just how it is here? If so then that kind of sucks. I can get behind the whole no in character posting rule, that would ruin the immersion completely, but instead of calling people names and making fun of their projects, why not just ignore them ? I dont know, maybe im taking this too seriously, but I just found it to be a bummer.	2021-09-04 00:57:04.016029	2021-09-04 00:57:04.016037	https://www.reddit.com/r/ARG/comments/ifrjf1/whu_does_the_community_on_this_sub_feel_so_toxic/

The full message is below:\n\n    You recieve a broadcast from an unknown number.\n\n***Your connection to the wildcard will cost you more than her life but also yours.

I'm trying to break it	On December 18th someone created [this thread](https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/297421482/#297421482) on 4chan. It consisted of an image of the "Sons of Liberty" flag, the following cypher, and nothing more.\n\n    RKCVS DEYWI WOJKS UMNWG PZCSJ\n    CXRFL AHTFS YULFO XPSPN IXCPB\n    TGMVV YMSCB OKVVZ VITHX VHHRA\n    FYQUM ZDQOJ OVBSC QJIAV LKJZT\n    STVSU SGIWQ XYHCN PZMLU ZDKRI\n    JBEZR ZPLPS GYMTK JOJKF KHYVO\n    APLHO GTQBX NGXLI HOCFR XFRXB\n    HGZXG YZNSP ICTUN YUQCK LUSUA\n    QEMAV HGBHV XHEGI SVUFY USPTX\n    CBYZR ZASWP AATKP FIERL YWCKM\n    WUBAJ FWCAO MHOVA DSCGJ FKTMI\n    SXUTL YURBL PSMAT YXSKW QXZKJ\n    RYHXH BAYEQ MBLTN HIDAR BCTSH\n    WBREU ASCPT UESZA KCXQZ MIYYM\n    IJRVK FSEAO QFOQB IWNPT XGMYJ\n    STPNF CYVTF OAHYD SQJBN MXXPY\n    HVVNT ZYWQE MJBSQ NERLC JCFUJ\n\nThe image is in png   format, and a zlib compressed file is hidden in it using steganography.  The file can be extracted and uncompressed using the following Linux command: `binwalk -e 1608339394823.png`.\n\nThe  resulting file is binary and 1081200 bits long. Most of it is filled with 0's, but sometimes 1's appear. After breaking it in chunks of 8  bits and analyzing the result, I found that sequences of numbers appear  in very specific positions:\n\n    Bit position | Sequence of numbers\n    \n    0    | 1, 237, 28, 36, 255\n    101  | 18, 227, 219\n    201  | 238, 29, 37\n    301  | 18, 227, 219\n    401  | 238, 29, 37\n    501  | 18, 227, 219\n    601  | 238, 29, 37\n    701  | 18, 227, 219\n    801  | 238, 29, 37\n    901  | 2\n    1802 | 2\n    2703 | 2\n    ...\n    134249 | 2\n\nI have converted the   numbers to decimal for convenience. For instance, at position 0 the file  has the following sequence of numbers:\n\n00000001 11101101 00011100 00100100 11111111\n\nwhich  convert to 1, 237, 28, 36, 255 once you break the sequence into blocks  of 8 numbers. After that you get several blocks of 00000000 until at  position 101 a new sequence begins.\n\nI  don't know the meaning of the file or how it relates to the cypher, all  I know is that the numbers in the alternating rows from 101 to 801 add  to 256: 18 + 238 = 227 + 29 = 219 + 37 = 256 (see the table above).\n\nDoes anyone have an idea of how to break this? I have never seen anything like it and it is quite mysterious.\n\nV sbyybjrq gur ehyrf	2021-09-04 02:34:58.431299	2021-09-04 02:34:58.431314	https://www.reddit.com/r/codes/comments/kj062y/someone_posted_this_cypher_on_4chan_im_trying_to/

What kind of cypher/encoding is this?	I encountered a program that is packaged alongside a Wii U emulator software of sorts and after decompiling it, I've found that it uses the following code to convert a base 64 encoded string into some readable text.\n\n `byte b = (byte)this.numericUpDown1.Value;`  \n `byte[] array = Convert.FromBase64String("UScgCgoIXUNDXwReQ15GT0FPU1kETVsIEAoIGxoeBBsYEwQfHAQbGR0IBicgCgoIGU5ZBF5DXkZPQU9TWQRNWwgQCggbGh4EGxgTBB8cBBsZHQgnIFc=");`  \n `for (int i = 0; i < array.Length; i++)`  \n `{`  \n `array[i] ^= b;`  \n `}` \n\nthe output of which is:\n\n    {\n      "wiiu[.]titlekeys[.]gq": "104[.]129[.]56[.]137",\n      "3ds[.]titlekeys[.]gq": "104[.]129[.]56[.]137"\n    }\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have defanged the domains and IPs as I can not personally attest to their safety.

Hi, Reddit, miss me?Probably didn't, but I digress. Anyways, it's time for another Roblox-related puzzle.This is probably easier than stuff that was posted here on the same matter but not sure how far it may extend.So here's the relevant document:  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/12XfrGNUCH5h4yr9pTdUVhrQUfWk4U9xnA-r3cVlD0Xs/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12XfrGNUCH5h4yr9pTdUVhrQUfWk4U9xnA-r3cVlD0Xs/edit)And here's the plaintext though the document is already non-copy locked:\n\n**RESOLVE**THE FOURTH SEAGULL FLIES AWAY,\n\nFIRST NORTH 14 DEGREES,\n\nSECOND SOUTH 19 DEGREES.\n\nSHE SCREAMS FOR THREE SECONDS,\n\nTHEN STOPS FACING SOUTH, 19 DEGREES SOUTH.\n\nSHE SINGS OF GOLD WHILE FLYING,\n\nSEVEN TIMES OVER.\n\nSHE TURNS,SHE SEES EIGHT OTHER SEAGULLS.\n\nTHEY TURN 12 DEGREES TOWARDS THE LEFT,\n\nAND TAKE OFF IN THE SAME DIRECTION:A TALE OF A LOST PILGRIM, KNOWN AS M3.oemyu://hbmo.ksxtik.hsj/asfbwxmm/t/1hh1byk1f7qhob5ui\\_zvgnsgr8pqtqk4j59kj243c3pg/llow?zwj=mveifwq\n\nDM me if it breaks, or if you think something is broken.\n\nNow,  though I am worried about this last bit about stuff breaking, I doubt so, if you do however spot said break, please PM me or just comment on this post outlining the mistake and I'll DM the author. Anyways. So far we know, or at least presume the code on the second last line is encrypted via vigenére (is that how you spell it?) cypher. It might be something similar but one thing known about the cypher used is that it doesn't have a letter represented by another symbol consistency, we know this because the link is obviously a google doc and the beginning is "https" and as we see where the 2   't's are, there are two different symbols. I think that the key to this cypher is hidden somewhere within the stated above "poem" you would call it? I'm not quite certain about it, but there's a hidden meaning behind the directions "North 14 Degrees" "South 19 degrees" and such. I'm not expert at geography and it's the use of NESW positioning on the globe so it may be relevant, may not be. The **key** to this is to find the *key* to this cypher. Of course, if you do stumble upon something like a google form or something similar that would be easily exploitable, I'd rather if you PM it to me so that it won't get leaked, but no need if you don't want to.\n\nMuch help appreciated!  \nEdit: I'm using the  [https://cryptii.com/](https://cryptii.com/) as a source of decrypting so please do take that into consideration when answering.\n\n**May it be known to the bot:                                  <------- NOT PART OF THE PUZZLE                             V sbyybjrq gur ehyrf                                           <------- NOT PART OF THE PUZZLE**	2021-09-04 02:36:05.959906	2021-09-04 02:36:05.959916	https://www.reddit.com/r/codes/comments/i74g94/possible_relevance_to_the_directions_in_the_text/

Back in highschool we had a class on ww2 and the enigma ecryptor thingermabob and I thought it was pretty cool. We had to come up with our own version of a code thinger and I didnt have anyone break mine. I have no idea about encoding anything so I dont know how good the encryption was. I'm curious to see how fast the best of reddit can crack the code. In all honest it is super simple and will probably take someone on here 5 minutes. But I'm curious to see. \n\nThe following passage is a snippet of a famous american speech written in plain English. I dont know any form of computer coding or translation or anything so the fancier you get. The further odd the mark you probably are. It's a very simple solution, potentially common practice. But I dont know enough about the subject to say. Hopefully it provides some breif moment of fun.\n\n\nUJH XQUPI JU WGUC EKIJJXLVC OQZ\nGQU NCQ IQOHX JP IKV NQUXFR ICQHX\nUJH QQZIW UQ BDRPNYO BNO GQUQX PH\nIWPES QQYIWZF BPG BNO GQUQX PH\nIWPES MKII BPG ZGW UJH TCPI\nSGYSQAAQXXLDL CGOMJLZ GQU XJLGM\nPWU GQUIGKHZB GQXKMZ BTH TVLPQ BV\nJUVYJ BTRYSJ UJH HNRFJ UJH CGOMJL\nUJDX UJH SKJLYY PH NCQ DQPI OQW\nGTRQ UJH HGQIWUZQCI PH UJH TVDXJ\nCWW GTRQ UJH ICQH PH HQG KQKR G \nLGQRJJF\n\n\n\nMandatory reddit thinger?
